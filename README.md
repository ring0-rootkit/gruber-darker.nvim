# NOTE
This is a fork of this repo https://github.com/ring0-rootkit/gruber-darker.nvim
I've changed some colors to suit my needs, but you are welcome to use that and contribute.
(I've made popup windows darker than in original repo)

## Installation

### Lazy (recommended)

```lua
{ "ring0-rootkit/gruber-darker.nvim" }
```

### Packer

```lua
use "ring0-rootkit/gruber-darker.nvim"
```

### Plug

```vim
Plug 'ring0-rootkit/gruber-darker.nvim'
```

Then, somewhere in your `init.lua`, set the colorscheme

```lua
vim.cmd.colorscheme("gruber-darker")
```

## Configuration

### Defaults

```lua
{
  bold = true,
  invert = {
    signs = false,
    tabline = false,
    visual = false,
  },
  italic = {
    strings = true,
    comments = true,
    operators = false,
    folds = true,
  },
  undercurl = true,
  underline = true,
}
```

### With updated preferences

Change configuration options by calling `setup()`
prior to loading the colorscheme. Your preferences
will be merged with the defaults.

For example, with [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git)...

```lua
{
  "ring0-rootkit/gruber-darker.nvim",
  opts = {
    bold = false,
    italic = {
      strings = false,
    },
  },
}
```
